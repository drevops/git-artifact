## üåü With Git Artifact, you can:

üì¶ Assemble a code artifact locally or in CI<br/>
üßπ Exclude any unwanted files using a deployment `.gitignore`<br/>
üì§ Transfer the final artifact to a destination Git repository for deployment<br/>
üîÅ Choose between `force-push` or `branch` modes to fit your workflow<br/>

See example of deployed artifact
in [Artifact branches](https://github.com/drevops/git-artifact-destination/branches).

## üîÄ Workflow

1Ô∏è‚É£ üßë‚Äçüíª Develop in the _source_ repository<br/>
2Ô∏è‚É£ üì¶ CI installs dependencies and runs **git-artifact** to package and push code to _destination_ repository<br/>
3Ô∏è‚É£ üöÄ Deployment triggered whan code received<br/>

## üéöÔ∏è Modes

### `force-push` mode (default)

Push the packaged artifact to the **same branch** in the _destination_ repository.
This will carry over the branch history from the _source_ repository and will overwrite
the existing branch history in the _destination_ repository.

```

                       Branch name identical to source

```

#### Use case

Forwarding all changes in the _source_ repository to the _destination_
repository **as-is** for **every branch**: for example, a commit in the _source_
repository branch `feature/123` would create a commit in the _destination_
repository branch `feature/123`. The next commit to the _source_ repository
branch `feature/123` would update the _destination_ repository branch
`feature/123` with the changes, but would overwrite the last "artifact commit".

### `branch` mode

Push the packaged artifact to the **new branch** in the _destination_ repository.
This will carry over the branch history from the _source_ repository to a
dedicated branch in the _destination_ repository. The follow-up pushes to the
branch in the _destination_ repository will be blocked.

 Tagged branch            New branch based on a new tag
 with a new tag

```

#### Use case

Creating a **new branch** in the _destination_ repository for every **tag**
created in the _source_ repository: for example, a tag `1.2.3` in the source
repository would create a branch `deployment/1.2.3` in the destination
repository. The addition of the new tags would create new unique branches in the
destination repository.

## üì• Installation

This package is intended to be used as a standalone binary. You will need to
have PHP installed on your system to run the binary.

Download the latest release from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/drevops/git-artifact/releases/latest).

You may also install the package globally using Composer:
```shell
composer global require --dev drevops/git-artifact
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

```shell
./git-artifact git@github.com:yourorg/your-repo-destination.git
```

This will create an artifact from current directory and will send it to the
specified remote repository into the same branch as a current one.

Avoid including development dependencies in your artifacts. Instead, configure
your CI to build with production-only dependencies, export the resulting code,
and use that as the artifact source. See our CI examples below.

Call from the CI configuration or deployment script:

```shell
export DEPLOY_BRANCH=<YOUR_CI_PROVIDER_BRANCH_VARIABLE>
./git-artifact git@github.com:yourorg/your-repo-destination.git \
  --branch="${DEPLOY_BRANCH}" \
  --push
```

CI providers may report branches differently when running builds triggered by tags.
We encourage you to explore our continuously and automatically tested examples:

- [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/test-php.yml)
- [CircleCI](.circleci/config.yml)

See extended and
fully-configured [example in the Vortex project](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/scripts/vortex/deploy-artifact.sh).

## üßπ Modifying artifact content

`--gitignore` option allows to specify the path to the artifact's `.gitignore`
file that replaces existing `.gitignore` (if any) during the build. Any files no
longer ignored by the replaced artifact's `.gitignore` are added into the
deployment commit. If there are no no-longer-excluded files, the deployment
commit is still created, to make sure that the deployment timestamp is
captured.

## üè∑Ô∏è Token support

Tokens are pre-defined strings surrounded by `[` and `]` and may contain
optional formatter. For example, `[timestamp:Y-m-d]` is
replaced with the current timestamp in format `Y-m-d` (token formatter), which
is PHP [`date()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php) expected format.

Both `--branch` and `--message` option values support token replacement.

Available tokens:

- `[timestamp:FORMAT]` - current time with a PHP [`date()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php)-compatible `FORMAT`.
- `[branch]` - current branch in the source repository.
- `[safebranch]` - current branch in the source repository with with all non-alphanumeric characters replaced with `-` and lowercased.
- `[tags:DELIMITER]` - tags from the latest commit in the source repository
  separated by a `DELIMITER`.

## Maintenance

### üß™ Testing

Packaging and deployment of artifacts is a mission-critical process, so we maintain
a set of unit, functional and integration tests to make sure that everything works
as expected.

You can see examples of the branches created by the Git Artifact in the [example _destination_ repository](https://github.com/drevops/git-artifact-destination/branches).

### Lint and fix code

```bash
composer lint
composer lint-fix
```

### Run tests

```bash
composer test
```
