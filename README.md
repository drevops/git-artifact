## What is it?

A tool to assemble a code artifact from your codebase, eliminate unwanted files,
and push it into a separate Git repository.

## Why?

In hosting environments like Acquia, there are restrictions on the languages or
frameworks available for building applicationsâ€”for instance, the inability to
run composer install due to a read-only filesystem. Consequently, a website must
be developed in a separate (source) repository, compiled into an artifact either
locally or via CI, and then transferred to the hosting provider's version
control system (destination repository).

This tool facilitates such processes seamlessly: it uses a `.gitignore.deployment`
file to determine which files should be transferred to the destination
repository, ensuring only necessary files are included and leaving out those
specified by the ignore file.

Furthermore, since the destination repository requires a commit to incorporate
changes from the artifact (like CSS, JS, etc.), the tool offers two options for
this commit: `force-push` or `branch`, accommodating different workflow
preferences.

See example of deployed artifact
in [Artifact branches](https://github.com/drevops/git-artifact-destination/branches).

## Modes

### `force-push` mode (default)

Push the packaged artifact to the same branch in the destination repository,
carrying over the history from the source repository while overwriting the
existing history in the destination repository.

#### Use case

Forwarding all changes from the source repository to the destination
repository as-is for every branch: for example, a commit in the source
repository branch `feature/123` would create a commit in the destination
repository branch `feature/123`. The next commit to the source repository
branch `feature/123` would update the destination repository branch
`feature/123` with the changes, but would overwrite the last "deployment"
commit.

### `branch` mode

Push packaged artifact to the new branch on each deployment, preserving history
from the source repository, but requiring to trigger a deployment of newly
created branch after each deployment.

#### Use case

Creating a new branch in the destination repository for every tag
created in the source repository: for example, a tag `1.2.3` in the source
repository would create a branch `deployment/1.2.3` in the destination
repository. The addition of the new tags would create new unique branches in the
destination repository.

## Installation
```shell
composer require drevops/git-artifact
```

## Usage
```shell
./git-artifact git@github.com:yourorg/your-repo-destination.git
```

This will create an artifact from current directory and will send it to the
specified remote repository into the same branch as a current one.

### Run in CI

See examples:

- [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/test-php.yml)
- [CircleCI](.circleci/config.yml)

Call from CI configuration or deployment script:
```shell
export DEPLOY_BRANCH=<YOUR_CI_PROVIDER_BRANCH_VARIABLE>
./git-artifact git@github.com:yourorg/your-repo-destination.git \
  --branch="${DEPLOY_BRANCH}" \
  --push
```

See extended and
fully-configured [example in the DrevOps project](https://github.com/drevops/drevops/blob/develop/scripts/drevops/deploy-artifact.sh).

    Help:
      Push artifact of current repository to remote git repository.

### Adding dependencies

`--gitignore` option allows to specify the path to the artifact's `.gitignore`
file that replaces existing `.gitignore` (if any) during the build. Any files no
longer ignored by the replaced artifact's `.gitignore` are added into the
deployment commit. If there are no no-longer-excluded files, the deployment
commit is still created, to make sure that the deployment timestamp is
captured.

### Token support

Tokens are pre-defined strings surrounded by `[` and `]` and may contain
optional formatter (for flexibility). For example, `[timestamp:Y-m-d]` is
replaced with current timestamp in format `Y-m-d` (token formatter), which is
PHP `date()` expected format.

Both `--branch` and `--message` option values support token replacement.

Available tokens:

- `[timestamp:FORMAT]` - current time with a PHP `date()`-compatible `FORMAT`.
- `[branch]` - current branch in the source repository.
- `[tags:DELIMITER]` - tags from the latest commit in the source repository
   separated by a `DELIMITER`.

## Maintenance
