DEMO - [Artefact branches](https://github.com/integratedexperts/robo-git-artefact-destination/branches)

## Modes
### Force-push mode (default)
Push packaged artefact to the same branch, preserving the history from the source repository, but overwriting history in destination repository on each push.

```
--mode=force-push
```

### Branch mode
Push packaged artefact to the new branch on each deployment, preserving history from the source repository, but requiring to trigger a deployment of newly created branch after each deployment.

```
--mode=branch
```

## Usage

In your `RoboFile.php`:
```php
<?php
use IntegratedExperts\Robo\ArtefactTrait;

/**
 * Class RoboFile.
 */
class RoboFile extends \Robo\Tasks
{

    use ArtefactTrait {
        ArtefactTrait::__construct as private __artefactConstruct;
    }

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->__artefactConstruct();
    }
}
```

### Run
`robo artefact git@myserver.com/repository.git` - this will create an artefact from current directory and will send it to the specified remote repository into the same branch as a current one.

## Options
```
Usage:
  artefact [options] [--] <remote>

Arguments:
  remote                               Path to the remote git repository.

Options:
      --branch[=BRANCH]                Destination branch with optional tokens. [default: "[branch]"]
      --gitignore=GITIGNORE            Path to gitignore file to replace current .gitignore.

      --mode[=MODE]                    Mode of artefact build: branch, force-push or diff. Defaults to force-push. [default: "force-push"]
      --now=NOW                        Internal value used to set internal time.
      --push                           Push artefact to the remote repository. Defaults to FALSE.
      --report=REPORT                  Path to the report file.
      --root=ROOT                      Path to the root for file path resolution. If not specified, current directory is used.
      --show-changes                   Show changes made to the repo by the build in the output.
      --src=SRC                        Directory where source repository is located. If not specified, root directory is used.
  -h, --help                           Display this help message
  -q, --quiet                          Do not output any message
  -V, --version                        Display this application version
      --ansi                           Force ANSI output

      --progress-delay=PROGRESS-DELAY  Number of seconds before progress bar is displayed in long-running task collections. Default: 2s. [default: 2]

  -v|vv|vvv, --verbose                 Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug

Help:
  Push artefact of current repository to remote git repository.
```

### Adding dependencies
`--gitignore` option allows to specify the path to the _artefact gitignore_ file that replaces existing _.gitignore_ (if any) during the build. Any files no longer ignored by the replaced _artefact gitignore_ are added into the _deployment commit_. If there are no no-longer-excluded files, the _deployment commit_ is still created, to make sure that the deployment timestamp is captured.

### Token support
Both `--branch` and `--message` option values support token replacement. Tokens are pre-defined strings surrounded by `[` and `]` and may contain optional formatter (for flexibility). For example, `[timestamp:Y-m-d]` is replaced with current timestamp in format `Y-m-d` (token formatter), which is PHP `date()` expected format.

Available tokens:
- `[timestamp:FORMAT]` - current time with a PHP `date()`-compatible format.
- `[branch]` - current `source` branch.
- `[tags]` - tags from latest `_source` commit (if any), separated by comma.

## Examples
### Push branch to the same remote
```
robo artefact git@myserver.com/repository.git --push
```
In this example, all commits in the repository will be pushed to the same branch as current one with all processed files (assets etc.) captured in the additional deployment commit. `--push` flag enables actual pushing into remote repository.


### Push release branches created from tags
```
robo artefact git@myserver.com/repository.git --mode=branch --branch=release/[tags:-] --push
```
In this example, if the latest commit was tagged with tag `1.2.0`, the artefact will be pushed to the branch `release/1.2.0`. If there latest commit is tagged with multiple tags - they will be glued to gether with delimiter `-`, which would reult in the branch name `release/1.2.0-secondtag`.
